Running REGoth
==============

Once you have downloaded a build of REGoth or built it from source, you will find
a number of binaries to play with, like ``REGothWorldViewer``.

The most easy way to set up REGoth correctly is to drop everything somewhere into
the Gothic game installation you want to play. That means, create a sub-directory anywhere
you like and put the executables and everything that goes with it there.

For example, place it like this::

   C:/Games/Gothic2/REGoth

Or like this::

   C:/Games/Gothic2/REGoth/Nightly-build-123/

or even like this::

   C:/Games/Gothic2/this/is/some/bogus/path

All of those will work.

.. note::

   REGoth will search the directory tree upwards for a gothic game installation, you can
   freely choose where you put REGoth, as long as it is somewhere inside a Gothic game
   directory.

Running from outside of a Gothic installation
---------------------------------------------

If you are building REGoth from source, it may be more comfortable to run it from
the build directory instead of copying it over to a Gothic installation. All REGoth
executables accept a path to a gothic game root as first commandline argument.

For example, you can run REGoth like this::

   ./REGothWorldViewer ~/games/Gothic2

.. note::

   **Windows**: When building from source, not all required DLLs are copied into the
   build directory automatically as of now. If you get complains about
   ``bsfPhysX.dll`` failing to load, try to copy the DLLs inside
   ``REGoth-bs/lib/bsf/Dependencies/PhysX/lib/`` next to your REGoth executables.

.. note::

   **Linux**: If you get complains about missing ``.so`` files when you try to run an
   executable, try running it as ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib ./REGothSomething``.
   Also, you might get an error indicating ``libPhysX3_x64.so`` not being found.
   You need to go into ``REGoth-bs/lib/bsf/Dependencies/PhysX/lib/`` and copy all
   ``.so``-files to the location where ``libbsf.so`` was built, usually
   ``REGoth/build/lib``.


The Asset Cache
---------------

When loading a world for the first time, REGoth will convert the resources of the original
Gothic game into a more modern format faster to load next time. If you want to re-import
everything, simply delete the `cache/` directory next to your REGoth executables.

If you only want to re-import a world, you can delete ``cache/worlds`` while leaving
the rest for faster startup time.
