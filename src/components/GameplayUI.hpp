  /**
   * Gameplay UI
   * ===========
   *
   * This is the base for all gameplay UI related things, including:
   *
   *  - Health-bars
   *  - Mana-bar
   *  - Dialogue
   *  - related
   *  - GUI
   *  - Stats-screen
   *  - Log-screen
   *  - In-game main menu
   *
   * Rather than implementing the UI code of those functionalities here, each of
   * those functions is implemented as a component: For example, the dialogue
   * choice box will have its own component, as well es the dialogue subtitle
   * box.
   *
   * Each of those specialized UI components is then attached to a new scene
   * object to build a tree-like structure with the scene object holding the
   * GameplayUI as base.
   *
   * The structure could look as follows (this is only an example):
   *
   *      +-- GameplayUI
   *          |
   *          +-- HUD
   *          |   +-- Bar (Health)
   *          |   +-- Bar (Mana)
   *          |   +-- Bar (Enemy Health)
   *          |
   *          +-- Dialogue UI
   *              +-- Subtitle Box
   *              +-- Choices
   *
   * While being a separation of concerns, this structure makes it possible to
   * use some UIs in different contexts. For example, the ingame menu is also
   * the main menu you see when you have just started the game. Then, no world
   * is loaded and no gameplay session exists, thus there is no GameplayUI.
   *
