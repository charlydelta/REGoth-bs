  /**
   * Waynet of a world.
   *
   * The Waynet is used by the characters for navigation and some
   * other scripting related things like placing an item at a
   * certain location.
   *
   * It consists out of Nodes called Waypoints, which have bi-directional
   * connections to other nodes. To naviage somewhere, the shortest path between
   * two nodes is taken.
   *
   * How exactly Gothic uses the waynet is still unknown. Tests with a simple
   * pathfinding algorithm have shown that there must be more to it. For
   * example:
   *
   *  In REGoth, before bs:f, the character showing the way from the old camp to
   *  the swamp will go though the forest, while he goes around the forest in
   *  the original.
   *
   * Maybe the characters are advised to go through the Outside-world, if
   * possible?
   *
   *
   * Freepoints and Waypoints
   * ========================
   *
   * The original engine uses Waypoints for most of the navigation. However,
   * the term *Freepoint* sometimes pops up in the same context. A Freepoint
   * is, even if the names are similar, fundamentally different from a
   * Waypoint. While a Waypoint is a specialized part of the Waynet, used for
   * navigation, a Freepoint is just a simple spot in the world.
   *
   * Those spots describe that a certain location could be used by a Character to
   * do something, without needing an object to interact with. For example,
   * there could be multiple Freepoints called `SIT` located around a fireplace.
   * Characters which are told to sit down by their daily routine will search
   * for a non-occupied freepoint with the name `SIT` and if they find one,
   * walk to it, mark the Freepoint as occupied and play the sitting-animation.
   *
   * Another use-case for Freepoints is for Monsters to know where to walk when
   * they are supposed to roam around their home-location. You will find multiple
   * Freepoints called `ROAM` scattered near monsters which they walk to in a
   * random order every so often.
   *
   *
   * Scene Object structure
   * ======================
   *
   * The object this component is attached to will be the parent of all
   * Waypoints this waynet has. So to search for a waypoint, you could simply
   * search the children of the Waynet-SO. Since this is a rather slow
   * operation, see findWaypoint() for alternatives.
   *
