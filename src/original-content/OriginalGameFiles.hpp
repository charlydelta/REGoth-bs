   * This class provides easy access to the original game files for all platforms.
   *
   * Since Gothic was developed on Windows-Systems, which uses a case-insensitive
   * file system, there are major differences in file naming between releases.
   * Sometimes a folder is called `Data`, `DATA` or `data`, you get the idea.
   *
   * This is troublesome for UNIX-systems which generally use case-sensitive
   * file systems.
   *
   * Another reason this class exists is so we can abstract away the paths to
   * certain files used by the engine.
   *
   * Generally, all paths you get back are in the correct case for your system.
